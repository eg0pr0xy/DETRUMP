## ðŸš€ Usage

- The mentions will be automatically covered with a black overlay
- Hover over the black overlay to see the tooltip "Content Hidden by DETRUMP"

## ðŸ§ª Testing

The extension includes two test files:

1. `test.html` - A simple test page with various examples of Trump mentions
2. `test_detailed.html` - An automated test suite that verifies proper functionality

To run the tests:
- Open either file in a browser after installing the extension
- For `test_detailed.html`, check the test results displayed on the page

## Development

### Extension Structure

- `manifest.json` - Configuration file for the Chrome extension
- `content.js` - Content script that detects and covers Trump mentions
- `styles.css` - Styling for the black overlay and tooltip
- `icons/` - Extension icons in various sizes

### How It Works

1. The content script uses regex with word boundaries to detect mentions of "Trump" or "Donald Trump"
2. Detected text is replaced with a span element with a black background
3. CSS styling adds the tooltip functionality
4. MutationObserver ensures dynamically loaded content is also processed

### Modifying the Extension

- **To change the replacement style**: Edit the `.detrump-covered` CSS class in `styles.css`
- **To change the tooltip text**: Edit the content in both the `title` attribute in `content.js` and the `content` property in the CSS
- **To modify detection patterns**: Edit the regex pattern in `content.js`
