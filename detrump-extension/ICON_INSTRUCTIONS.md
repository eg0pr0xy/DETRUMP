# DETRUMP Icon & Logo Guidelines

This document provides instructions for creating proper icons and logo for the DETRUMP Chrome extension.

## Icon Requirements

Chrome extensions require icons in multiple sizes:
- 16x16 pixels: Favicon for extension tabs
- 48x48 pixels: Extension management page
- 128x128 pixels: Chrome Web Store listing

## Design Concept

The recommended design concept is a **censorship-themed icon** representing the extension's purpose:

### Option 1: Black Censorship Bar
- A stylized silhouette with a black bar across the face/eyes
- Simple design with minimal colors (primarily black and white)
- Clear recognizable shape even at small sizes

### Option 2: Redacted Text
- The word "TRUMP" with a black redaction bar covering it
- High contrast for visibility at small sizes

### Option 3: No Entry Symbol
- A circle with a diagonal line across it
- A small "T" or stylized profile silhouette inside

## Icon Technical Requirements

For all icons:
- PNG format with transparency
- Sharp edges (no anti-aliasing for small icons)
- Recognizable even at 16x16 size
- Consistent style across all sizes

## Logo for GitHub and Documentation

For the full logo on GitHub and documentation:
- 800x200 pixels (wide banner format)
- Include the name "DETRUMP" in clear typography
- Incorporate the censorship theme from the icons
- Optional tagline: "Browse in peace"

## Color Palette

Recommended colors:
- Primary: Black (#000000)
- Secondary: White (#FFFFFF)
- Accent (optional): Red (#E61610) or Gray (#808080)

## Font Suggestions

For the logo text:
- Sans-serif fonts like Montserrat, Roboto, or Open Sans
- Consider stencil-style fonts for the censorship theme
- Bold weight for better visibility
